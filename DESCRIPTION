Description: The package performs Bayesian estimation of a monotone Single Index Model using B-Spline basis expansion. The monotone function is expressed as a B-Spline basis expansion, and its monotonicity is equivalently enforced by non-negativity of the basis coefficients. Priors are constructed on the of the unknown parameters - the basis coefficients, the single index parameter and the error variance of the model. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is performed to generate samples from their conditional posterior distributions.
